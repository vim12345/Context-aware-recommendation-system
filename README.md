# Context-aware-recommendation-system

# Description:
A context-aware recommendation system integrates additional contextual information (e.g., time of day, user location, weather, device type) to personalize recommendations. This is particularly useful when recommendations depend on the situation or environment.

In this project, we’ll implement a context-aware recommendation system where we consider the time of day to recommend items (e.g., recommending movies or products based on the user's current time).

# ✅ What It Does:
* Simulates session data with time of day context (morning, afternoon, evening)

* Recommends items based on time of day, making recommendations contextually aware

* Outputs item recommendations tailored to the user's context (e.g., time of day)
